In his defense~he said that he had never been~to New Orleans before. But~he was not hired because he did not have~a criminal record. So he hired a~woman named Mary Ann Hass to be~his witness and~she was very~good at her job. She was also~a very nice woman. And she had a great lawyer. Robert~was one of~those people who would~not let the truth get in his~way.~When the trial~began, he told the~jury that the~woman~who hired him~was MaryAnn~Hass, who worked for the New Jersey~State Attorney's Office. That was when the~judge decided that Hass had no criminal~records. Now, the defense attorneys~are trying to get Hass back on the stand.~Their goal is to have Hass on trial.~If they can get him back, they~will be able to
