Geometrical human bodies stay unaltered when faced with continuous transformations the menace of the microscopic, the anxiety for not being able to see the enemy The augmented mind moves into intangible realities leaving the physical to surrender to the cloud
 A defragmented core spreads into an iridium cover In every gap a soul pleads not to be given away in every turn an abyss appears appealing

Swallowed while we escape from humanity
we embrace the digits until we melt with the machine.
